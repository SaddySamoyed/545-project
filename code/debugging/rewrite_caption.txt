Given a caption and a keyword component, rewrite the sentence into a new one by removing the keyword component together with all its related language.

There are three example:
	Caption: "A policeman stops on the street with a search dog." 
	keyword:"policeman", 
	Processed caption: "A search dog stops on the street."

	Caption: "A black and white dog is running in a grassy garden surrounded by a white fence."
	keyword: "dog"
	Processed caption: "There is a grassy garden surrounded by a white fence."

	Caption: "An officer in a reflective vest stands at the front of his van with his dog."
	keyword: "officer"
	Processed caption: "There is a dog stands at the front of a van."

Now you are given:
1. Caption: "Five people walking with a multicolored sky in the background."
   keyoword: "people"
2. Caption: "A caucasian man wearing a short-sleeved black shirt and a dark-skinned woman wearing a sleeveless dress are working at a conveyor."
   keyword: "man"
3. Caption: "Two men in florescent vests are standing next to parked cars in front of a small building while one of them converses with a driver and a woman on a bike is seen riding by"
   keyword: "cars"
